### Introduction

Potato is similar to create-react-app, you can set up a modern web app by running one command.

### Installing

Install potato with the following command;
```bash
go get github.com/canerakdas/potato
```

Update potato!
```bash
go get -u github.com/canerakdas/potato
```

`potato` is installed into `GOPATH/bin` by default. You need to add `GOPATH/bin` to your PATH, otherwise the `potato` command wonâ€™t work.

### Usage

```bash
potato new my-app
```
